                Self-driving cars are poised to become the most impactful technology of the 21st century.
                Yet, to work on them, you must be in one of the few companies who have taken on the task.
                Even then, you would be working in relative isolation from
                other groups doing exactly the same thing.
                This does not have to be the case.
                <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/members">Linux</a>,
                <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/sponsors/">PostGres</a>,
                and
                <a href="http://www.osrfoundation.org/about/sponsors/">ROS</a>
                are just a few examples of a different approach --
                where companies, researchers, and individuals work together on foundational technology
                to create a common platform for bringing better products to market.
                DeepDrive aims to be that platform for self-driving cars powered by deep learning.
                By combining highly realistic simulations with hooks for deep learning,
                DeepDrive gives anyone with a computer the opportunity to build better self-driving cars.

            <div>The current generation of self-driving cars struggle in an urban setting at speeds above 25mph,
                requiring people to be ever-ready at the wheel.
                This problem is aggravated by the high cost of driving,
                high risk of accidents, and the
                resultant limitation on the ability to test new
                approaches.
                Modern video-games like GTAV, however, present a world
                where you can test self-driving car AI’s in large complex urban areas with
                realistic roads, weather, pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles
                with zero cost or risk. Additionally using
                deep learning in this environment offers the opportunity to learn
                the nuanced driving behaviors that we expect self-driving cars will have.</div>

            <br><br>
            <div>The incredibly high fidelity and vast open world provided by
                GTAV also presents the most complex virtual RL environment for
                testing interactive AI to date. This allows a new level of
                testing for safety in AI as existing environments don’t offer
                the same opportunities for
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565v1">reward hacking, distributional shift,
                and negative side effects.</a>
                Finally, developing self-driving cars
                out in the open provides a level of transparency not usually
                seen in AI applications and in an area where it is crucial to
                have visibility into both the safety and correctness of the
                system.</div>
