                    <p>TLDR; Deepdrive has been rebuilt without GTA and now includes support for multiple cameras,
                        depth, and running natively on Linux - All open source on Unreal Engine.

                    <p>A little over a year ago, I worked with OpenAI to release an integration for GTAV into
                        the Universe platform. The goal was to make one of the most complex video games available to
                        researchers to experiment with methods like
                        <a href="http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/">deep reinforcement learning</a>
                        for self-driving.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, it turned out that TakeTwo was not as receptive to people using GTAV for this purpose
                        <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2017/10/04/grand-theft-auto-v-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-diy-self-driving-car-lab/">as I had hoped.</a>

                        Deepdrive was taken down early 2017 due to
                        <br>
                        legal issues around using GTAV.

                    <p>I apologize for not having gotten TakeTwo's permission to use GTA.
                        I know that many of you had spent time with Deepdrive 1.0 and Deepdrive Universe, and am
                        deeply sorry for not being able to continue to support you.
                        I hope that rebuilding the project on Unreal will be able to restore what you
                        found valuable in the GTA version, and eventually do much more.
                    </p>
                    <p>Before Deepdrive Universe launched, I had started work at Uber's Advanced Technologies Group
                        on their perception team. Deepdrive caught their eye as relevant experience applying
                        deep learning to self-driving. It was also an opportunity to incorporate real world concerns
                        back into Deepdrive, something I was very grateful Uber was supportive of.

                        One thing I noticed early on there was that I had solved the same problems in simulation
                        as had been solved for real-world cars, but in a much different way. For example,
                        in imitation learning, you often need to
                        reduce sampling error when the training and test distributions

                        this is dealt with by "pretending" as if the left or right camera is in the
                        center of the car and generating a corresponding corrective steering action to get back
                        to the center of the lane.

                        then can interpolate between cameras to generate
                        additional corrective labels under the assumption of an infinite horizon - i.e. flat roads.

                        In simulation, we can (safely!) vary the trajectory of the car and see what an oracle
                        path-following AI does to correct its trajectory.

                        So it’d be great to use this simulated training to improve real-world performance as
                        we can try things with zero safety risk. Not only that, but we can "cheat" and
                        use the game's perfect 3D world model with
                        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00702">techniques like this</a> and
                        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03213">this</a> to adapt
                        driving to the real-world.

                        Excitingly, we found that neural networks trained on real-world
                        driving were able to drive in simulated environments, and therefore going the other direction
                        was promising, although not something we pursued.

                        Over the course of a year there,
                        I was able to familiarize myself more with the problems real self-driving cars ran into by
                        digging into the fundamental reasons for our disengagements and riding in test cars.
                        Doing so I became increasingly excited about what an open self-driving simulator could to help solve many of
                        these problems.

                        We evaluated many engines and Unreal not only checked the boxes, but <i>felt</i> best to us.
                        From a feature perspective Unreal is the only free, shared source, AAA engine available.
                        Having the source is critical as we might need to do crazy stuff like optimize eight
                        camera rendering, swapping out the physics engine, or running faster than real-time.

                        You may be wondering why we created our own sim in Unreal with all of these others out there.
                        While we actually were not aware of Carla when we started or that AirSim was doing
                        more than drones,
                        we found the following out after trying these ourselves:

                        <ol style="text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
                            <li >Our frame rates are higher (link to FAQ) while capturing several cameras, due to use of shared memory rather than sockets and asynchronous transfer.
                            <li>Our road surface is not flat, but hilly, curvy, and with different widths at different points
                            <li>Our assets - the map, cars, lighting, etc… are free, come with the project, and modifiable in Unreal.
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, I think it’s a great thing to have a variety of simulators available. A cross-simulator
                        benchmark would certainly be intriguing - as domain shift is a major obstacle for
                        simulation in general. If you’re interested in working on this,

                        fantastic GPU and CPU profilers.

                        Overall, we've been very happy with Unreal Engine, a AAA game development platform
                        with accessible and modifiable source, a promising long-term financial outlook due
                        to its immensely popular games, being free for non-commercial use,
                        and a solid start at becoming the engine of choice for self-driving simulation.
                        We look forward to contributing to the project and openly testing all self-driving AI
                        with it.
                    </p>


                    <h2>A final note</h2>
                   <p>
                       Creating fully autonomous cars will mean developing AI that has a
                       grounded understanding of physics, our 3D world, and how to interact, predict, and cooperate with
                       humans in a robust way. This makes it critically important that we develop self-driving
                       in a way that is sensitive to AI in general and the sweeping effects it will have, where
                       safety is of top importance. Deepdrive and our simulation platform are therefore
                       about more than testing self-driving cars. It's about openly developing artificial
                       intelligence optimized for safety before AI gets to a point where the time for setting
                       a precedant and building responsible practices, community, and infrastructure has passed.
