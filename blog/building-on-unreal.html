                <p>TLDR; Deepdrive has been rebuilt without GTA using Unreal Engine.

                <h2>Background - <a class="skip-link" href="#unreal">or skip to Unreal stuff</a></h2>
                <p>A little over a year ago, I worked with OpenAI to release an integration for GTAV into
                    the Universe platform. The goal was to make one of the most complex video games available to
                    researchers to experiment with methods like
                    <a href="http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/">deep reinforcement learning</a>
                    for self-driving.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, it turned out that TakeTwo was not
                    <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2017/10/04/grand-theft-auto-v-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-diy-self-driving-car-lab/"
                    >as receptive</a>
                    to people using GTAV for this purpose as I had hoped.

                <p>I apologize for not having gotten TakeTwo's permission to use GTA.
                    I know that many of you had spent time with Deepdrive 1.0 and Deepdrive Universe, and am
                    deeply sorry for not being able to continue to support your efforts.
                    I hope that rebuilding the project on Unreal will be able to restore what you
                    found valuable in the GTA version, and eventually do much more.
                </p>
                <p>Before the Universe integration launched, I had started work at Uber's Advanced Technologies Group
                    on their perception team. Deepdrive caught their eye as relevant experience applying
                    deep learning to self-driving. It was also an opportunity to incorporate real world concerns
                    back into Deepdrive, something I was grateful that Uber was supportive of.

                    One thing I noticed early on there was that I had solved some of the same problems in simulation
                    as had been solved for real-world cars, but in a much different way. For example,
                    in imitation learning, you often need to
                    reduce sampling error when the training and test distributions
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/C_LGsoe36I8?t=14m31s">are not IID.</a>

                    In real cars this
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316">is dealt with</a>,
                    by "pretending" as if the left or right camera is in the
                    center of the car and generating a corresponding corrective steering action to get back
                    to the center.
                    <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~seitz/papers/thesis.pdf">Viewpoint transformation</a>
                    then can interpolate between cameras to generate
                    additional corrective labels under the assumption of an infinite horizon - i.e. flat roads.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In simulation, we can (safely!) vary the trajectory of the car and see what an oracle
                    path-following AI does to correct its trajectory.
                </p>

                        Frames captured after random actions are discarded, so that
                        the agent is only trained on the course corrective behavior.

                <p class="pretrain-prose">
                    So it’d be great to use simulated training to improve real-world performance as
                    we can get much more accurate corrective actions. More broadly, we can just try a lot more
                    and do so much more safely.
                    One of the amazing potential opportunities in simulation is to
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00702">learn</a> to create a 3D model from 2D images,
                    then use
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03213">GANs</a> to adapt
                    that mapping to the real-world.

                    Excitingly, when we worked on verifying this idea at Uber - that agents can transfer between real and
                    virtual environments, we found that neural networks trained on real-world
                    driving were able to drive in simulated environments surprisingly well. e.g.
                    The car would steer in the correct direction and stay in the lane, although it would
                    swerve more than it did on a real road.
                    This meant going the other direction
                    was promising (virtual->real), and something I am still very bullish about trying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the course of a year at Uber,
                    I was able to familiarize myself more with the problems real autonomous vehicles by
                    digging into the fundamental reasons for our disengagements and riding along in test cars.
                    Doing so gave me a deep appreciation for the difficultly of the problem
                    and caused me to become increasingly excited about what an open self-driving simulator could to
                    help solve make self-driving happen.

                    The first step in developing Deepdrive 2.0 was choosing an engine.
                    Of the many we evaluated, Unreal not only checked the boxes, but <i>felt</i> best to us.
                    From a feature perspective Unreal is the only free, shared source, AAA engine available.
                    Having the source is critical as we're going to need to optimize 8+
                    camera rendering, possibly swap out the physics engine, and run faster than real-time.

                    are also using Unreal. It’s my hope these sims can reuse components
                    and cooperate. We have already worked with the Carla team on some synchronization functionality
                    and it’s very exciting to see the growing community around open self-driving.

                <p>
                    You may be wondering why we created our own open source sim in Unreal with the other options available.
                    While we actually were not aware of Carla, or that AirSim was doing
                    more than drones,
                    we found the following out after the fact:

                    <ol style="text-align: left; font-size: 17.68px;">
                        <li>Our frame rates are higher while capturing several cameras, due to use of shared memory rather
                            than sockets and asynchronous transfer.</li>
                        <li>Our road surface is not flat, but hilly, curvy, and varies in width</li>
                        <li>Our assets - the map, cars, lighting, etc… are free, come with the project, and modifiable in
                            Unreal.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I think it’s great, however, to have a variety of simulators available. A cross-simulator
                    benchmark would be extremely helpful for helping test agents ability to transfer
                    between environments before transferring into the real-world. If you’re interested in working on this,

                <p>
                    You don't need to develop in Unreal to use Deepdrive. You just need to write Python.
                    However, I think it's interesting
                    and sometimes very helpful to be able to modify the environment for your experiments.

                    GPU and CPU profilers and reimplement slow Blueprint code in C++.

                    Overall, we've been very happy with Unreal Engine, a AAA game development platform
                    with accessible and modifiable source,
                    and a solid start at becoming the engine of choice for self-driving simulation.
                    We look forward to allowing many more people to use it for improving the state of the art
                    in self-driving.
                </p>

                <h2>A final note</h2>
                <p>
                    Creating fully autonomous cars will mean developing AI that has a
                    grounded understanding of physics, our 3D world, and how to interact, predict, and cooperate with
                    humans in a robust way. Simulation allows us to do this
                    in a way that is sensitive sweeping effects AI will have, where
                    ensuring safety, transparency, and broad participation
                    are of utmost importance. Deepdrive is
                    about more than testing self-driving cars. It's about openly developing AI
                    optimized for safety before AI gets to a point where the time for setting
                    a precedent and building responsible practices, community, and infrastructure has passed.
                    It's also important to realize how unique self-driving is in that privacy and secrecy concerns are
                    far fewer than other large AI applications (i.e. search and social), and that involving more people
                    is not only good for long-term safety democratization of AI, but is also extremely helpful
                    in making the technology safer in the short-term.
